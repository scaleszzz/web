              <h3> Biography </h3>
              <p>My name is Aybar. Now I am 18 years old. I was born on October 8 and live in Aktobe. Well, like everyone else, I went to kindergarten.
                When I was 5 years old, I went to school. School years flew by very quickly, they were full of interesting moments and, of course, bad ones.
                I am an ambivert. I like to communicate with people I know, but I hate when there are too many people in one place. I like to compose music.
                I started doing music when I was in high school, and I still do music. I watch anime and play computer games, sometimes it helps to distract from real life.
                In high school, I became interested in programming and, of course, became interested in it. I couldn't choose a university for a long time,
                but in the 10th grade I decided to choose MUIT and promised to come here. Now I am a 3rd year student. </p>

                  <h3>Hobby</h3>
                  <p> Many people have hobbies. They make our life more interesting
                    A hobby is something that people would like to do when they have free
                    time. Everyone chooses a hobby according to his character and taste. 
                    My hobbies are making music, watching anime and playing computer games. 
                    You can listen to my music on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/set.sunaa_/" class="name">instagram!</a></p>
